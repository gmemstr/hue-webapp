* Hue Webapp

** What is this?

I'm a bit tired of how slow the official Hue app is, so I decided to
throw together a quick webapp for doing some of the simple functions
required. So far this only toggles individual bulbs, but considering
I'll be using this a fair amount myself more to come.

** Setup

While [[http://www.burgestrand.se/hue-api]] is still relatively useful,
some changes were made to the bridge API, specifically around
[[https://developers.meethue.com/important-whitelist-changes/][authenticating new "users"]]. It's easy to adapt - when [[http://www.burgestrand.se/hue-api/api/auth/registration/][registering an
applicaton]], simply omit the username and note down the one the bridge
sends back. Enter this into the web.py file, along with the IP address
of your bridge. At some point I'll move these to environment variables,
but it's 11:27PM at night and I want to sleep.

Then just =./web.py= and visit [[localhost:8081]].
